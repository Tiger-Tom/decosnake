I've tried to replace all of Python with decorators for fun.

The code is for my Lovecraft inspired video, check it out [here](https://youtu.be/1rHno-bUUx0)!

## Instructions

Make sure you have PDM installed, I recommend using pipx to install it.
[My video on how to use both](https://youtu.be/cOFyf0_CDhI). Shameless plug, yes.

After that, run `pdm install` to editable install the package.

Run with `python -m decosnake` or `pdm run python -m decosnake` if outside the pdm managed venv.
